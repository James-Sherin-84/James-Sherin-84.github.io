                    <p>Boss fights are a way to unlock new features in the game and to increase your NUMBER. They use attack and defense acquired in training. HP while fighting is 10*attack, and HP regain is defense/20. After boss 20, the attack, defense and max hp will increase 10 fold with respect to previous boss. You can instantly skip bosses with the nuke button, if you are strong enough to kill it (around 1000x the stats of a boss). Also, you might have noticed the random letters at the bottom of the story box at certain bosses. This might be important for something later. ;></p>
                    <p>Adventure mode is a feature that is unlocked by defeating boss 4. It is essentially a mini-game within the game in which a character can progress and acquire equipments that allows for them to get even further into the game. Currently, there are 47 different zones, each with their own respective bosses, monsters, and loot. Enemies respawn at a rate of four seconds each. This time can be shortened with set bonus, equipment, NGUs, Perk, and Wishes. The adventure mode screen also enables access to the Bestiary, the ITOPOD and to Perks</p>

                    <p>Whenever you defeat a boss enemy from the adventure (ones marked with a yellow crown), it has a chance to drop equipment which will show up in your Inventory. Whenever you defeat a normal mob, it will have a chance to drop one or (rarely) two boosts. Titans may drop multiple loots. The chance for enemies to drop loot can be vastly multiplied, mainly through specials on the equipment itself, but also through Blood Magic's Blood Spaghetti, 2D Set's Set Bonus, Yggdrasil's Fruit of Luck, NGU Drop Chance, Drop Chance Gold Diggers, Neckbeard Beard, Drop Chance Hacks, and Drop Chance Cards. For zones Chocolate World and beyond, drop chance is given by the cubic root of the drop chance bonus and a zone factor F in the form of:</p>
                    <p>For a list of all the items see Item List, and for more info about them, see Inventory. If you hover the mouse cursor over the name of the current adventure zone (at the top of the page), a tooltip will show you what your total drop chance is in that zone. If your drop chance is at its maximum for that zone, it will appear green. The tooltip also shows what adventure stats are needed to activate AutoKill for that zone or selected Titan level and a "Zone Kill Counter" which determines when the next MacGuffin Fragment will drop. In the ITOPOD, the tooltip also shows when the next AP and EXP rewards will be granted.</p>

                    <!-- After the closing heading tag, add three (3) paragraphs of text. -->
                    
                    <p>Idle values indicate minimum toughness to maintain about 90% health and enough Power to kill any exploder. In order to AutoKill (AK) the Titans you need to meet the given requirements and turn on the "Automatically Kill Titans" setting. While AK works offline too, you need to have the given stats before closing the game, because any progress you made will be calculated at the restart and does not work retroactively. * = Unconfirmed value. WARNING: For exact chances, drop requirements, and information which items drop independent of each other see individual zone/titan pages.</p>
                    <p>The cost to level augmentations up scales linearly and is equal to Base cost * n where n is the level you want to upgrade the augment to, so leveling Safety Scissors to level 1 costs 10,000 gold, level 2 costs 20,000, level 3 costs 30,000, etc. Normal No Augs Challenge increase leveling speed, increasing the base stat multiplier, and decrease the cost for upgrades; Evil No Augs Challenges gives evenmore leveling speed. In normal, it takes 400 seconds to level up either Safety or Danger Scissors with 1000 Energy allocated and 1 Energy Power.</p>
                    <p>Starting from Milk, the augment's stat multiplier is increase to the power of 1.1, and increased by 0.1 for each new tier of augments. This can be increase by normal Laser Sword Challenge. In evil, the energy requirement is 2.5 trillion (2.5e12) times the energy requirement in normal. In SADISTIC, the energy requirement is 1 quadrillion (1e15) times the energy requirement in evil. Each augmentation takes 17 times more time to level than last one (starting from scissors). This multiplier increases to 1400 for Advanced Exoskeleton and Laser Sword.</p>

                    <p>Defeating bosses will gradually unlock upgrades for all augmentations, and those will multiply the augment's stat multiplier by a set amount each level, costing much more gold than the first augmentation levels, and also costing more and more gold per upgrade. All Augmentation Upgrades will multiply their corresponding Augmentation's bonus by 1 + Upgrade Level² and cost Base Cost * n² in gold where n is the level you want to upgrade the augment to, and cost Base Cost * n in energy in the same manner as Augmentations. <br><a href="#">&#x26AB; &#x26AB; &#x26AB;</a></p>

It allows you to automate and drastically speed up gold collection by going back in time and re-loot the gold of previous conquests from in Adventure Mode. It requires energy and magic to be allocated and some gold to level up. This machine will produce gold based on the best gold drop that you have received in Adventure Mode.

The maximum speed that the machine can be leveled to is 1 fill per tick (aka level 50 or 50 fills per second). If you level your machine speed beyond level 50, you receive an additional, stacking multiplier to your gold output every level. Level up your Gold Multiplier by using your magic and some initial gold. This essentially is just a basic multiplier to gold output. The highest boss that you have ever defeated will also multiply your gold output. Highest Boss - 27 = Gold Multiplier (max of 274x)<br><a href="#">&#x26AB; &#x26AB; &#x26AB;</a></p>
